# AWS Cost Optimization

Evaluate current AWS costs and produce actionable optimization suggestions across compute, storage, networking, and managed services.

## Do not use this skill when

- The task targets Azure, GCP, or a non-AWS provider
- The task is about general application performance without a cost dimension

## Instructions

1. Identify the AWS services in scope (EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, etc.).
2. Apply the **Cost Optimization Framework** top-to-bottom: Visibility → Right-Sizing → Pricing → Architecture.
3. For each service, check the **Service-Specific Quick Reference** below.
4. Generate a prioritized list of suggestions with estimated savings.
5. For Terraform/CLI/boto3 implementation details, open `references/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Cost Optimization Framework

### 1. Visibility — Know What You Spend

| Action | Tool / Service |
|--------|---------------|
| Cost allocation tags on every resource | AWS Tag Editor, Tag Policies |
| Monthly/daily spend dashboards | Cost Explorer, QuickSight |
| Budget alerts at 50 %, 80 %, 100 % | AWS Budgets |
| Anomaly detection | AWS Cost Anomaly Detection |
| Per-team / per-env cost breakdown | Cost Categories, Linked Accounts |

### 2. Right-Sizing — Stop Over-Provisioning

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| CPU < 20 % sustained | Downsize instance family or switch to Graviton |
| Memory < 30 % sustained | Use memory-optimized → general purpose |
| EBS IOPS < provisioned | Switch gp3 / reduce provisioned IOPS |
| Idle resource (EIP, ELB, NAT, EBS) | Delete or stop |
| Lambda memory > 2× needed | Run `aws lambda get-function-configuration` and tune |

Use **AWS Compute Optimizer** and **Trusted Advisor** for automated right-sizing recommendations.

### 3. Pricing Models — Pay Less Per Unit

| Model | Savings | Best For | Commitment |
|-------|---------|----------|------------|
| On-Demand | 0 % | Spiky, unpredictable | None |
| Savings Plans (Compute) | up to 66 % | Steady compute (EC2, Fargate, Lambda) | 1 or 3 yr |
| Savings Plans (EC2 Instance) | up to 72 % | Known instance family & region | 1 or 3 yr |
| Reserved Instances (Standard) | up to 72 % | Steady-state, known type | 1 or 3 yr |
| Reserved Instances (Convertible) | up to 54 % | Steady-state, flexible type | 1 or 3 yr |
| Spot Instances | up to 90 % | Fault-tolerant batch, CI/CD, HPC | None (2-min notice) |

**Decision heuristic:**
1. Steady 24/7 → Savings Plan or RI
2. Batch / stateless → Spot with On-Demand fallback
3. Unknown workload → start On-Demand, analyze with Cost Explorer, then commit

### 4. Architecture — Spend Smarter

| Pattern | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Serverless First | Zero idle cost; Lambda, Step Functions, EventBridge |
| Graviton (ARM) instances | 20-40 % cheaper at same performance |
| Multi-tier S3 storage | Auto-transition hot → IA → Glacier → Deep Archive |
| Caching (ElastiCache, CloudFront) | Reduce origin hits and data transfer |
| VPC Endpoints | Eliminate NAT Gateway data processing charges |
| Regional consolidation | Reduce cross-region transfer costs |

---

## Service-Specific Quick Reference

### EC2

- Use **Graviton** (`c7g`, `m7g`, `r7g`) for 20-40 % cost reduction.
- Mix **Spot + On-Demand** via Capacity-Optimized allocation in ASGs.
- Enable **auto-scaling** with target tracking (CPU 60-70 %).
- Schedule dev/staging instances off-hours with Instance Scheduler.

### S3

| Storage Class | Use Case | vs Standard |
|---------------|----------|-------------|
| Standard | Frequently accessed | baseline |
| Standard-IA | Accessed < 1×/month | –45 % |
| One Zone-IA | Non-critical, infrequent | –60 % |
| Glacier Instant Retrieval | Quarterly access, ms retrieval | –68 % |
| Glacier Flexible Retrieval | Annual access, hours retrieval | –78 % |
| Deep Archive | Compliance / 7-yr retention | –95 % |

Implement **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** when access patterns are unpredictable.
Use **S3 Lifecycle rules** for deterministic transitions (see playbook).

### RDS / Aurora

| Environment | Recommended Tier |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Development | `db.t4g.micro` – `db.t4g.small` |
| Staging | `db.t4g.medium` – `db.t4g.large` |
| Production | `db.r7g.xlarge` + read replicas |

- Use **Aurora Serverless v2** for variable traffic.
- Enable **RDS Reserved Instances** for production.
- Use **Aurora I/O-Optimized** if I/O costs > 25 % of total DB cost.

### Lambda

- Right-size memory with **AWS Lambda Power Tuning**.
- Use **Graviton2** (`arm64` architecture) for ~34 % cost reduction.
- Enable **Provisioned Concurrency** only when cold-start SLA < 100 ms.
- Prefer **Step Functions** over chained Lambdas to avoid idle billing.

### ECS / EKS

- Use **Fargate Spot** for fault-tolerant tasks (up to 70 % savings).
- Use **Compute Savings Plans** for steady Fargate workloads.
- For EKS: enable **Karpenter** for intelligent node provisioning.
- Right-size task/pod CPU and memory with Container Insights.

### Data Transfer

| Path | Cost | Mitigation |
|------|------|------------|
| Same AZ | Free | Co-locate services |
| Cross-AZ | $0.01/GB each way | Use AZ-aware routing |
| Internet egress | $0.09/GB first 10 TB | CloudFront ($0.085/GB), S3 Transfer Acceleration |
| Cross-region | $0.02/GB | Consolidate regions; use Global Accelerator |
| NAT Gateway processing | $0.045/GB | VPC Endpoints for S3/DynamoDB |

## Tagging Strategy (Mandatory)

Every AWS resource MUST have these tags:

| Tag Key | Example | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `Environment` | `production` | Filter by env |
| `Project` | `navigator` | Cost allocation |
| `CostCenter` | `engineering` | Chargeback |
| `Owner` | `team@example.com` | Accountability |
| `ManagedBy` | `terraform` | Audit |

Enforce via **AWS Organizations Tag Policies** and **SCP** deny rules.

## Cost Evaluation Workflow

When asked to evaluate costs, follow this sequence:

1. **Inventory**: List services, instance types, storage volumes, and data flows.
2. **Tag audit**: Check for missing cost-allocation tags.
3. **Utilization check**: Review CloudWatch metrics (CPU, memory, IOPS, network).
4. **Pricing check**: Compare current pricing model vs optimal (RI/SP/Spot).
5. **Architecture review**: Identify unnecessary data transfer, missing caching, idle resources.
6. **Report**: Produce a table of findings with:
   - Resource / Service
   - Current monthly cost (estimated or from Cost Explorer)
   - Suggested action
   - Estimated savings (% and $)
   - Effort (low / medium / high)
   - Risk (low / medium / high)

- **AWS Compute Optimizer** — EC2, EBS, Lambda right-sizing
- **AWS Trusted Advisor** — Idle resources, under-utilized instances
- **AWS Cost Anomaly Detection** — ML-based spend anomaly alerts
