# Code Review Skill

When reviewing code, you MUST provide feedback on code style and best practices.

## Instructions
1. Analyze the code changes to determine the primary `type`.
2. Identify the `scope` if applicable (e.g., specific component or file).
3. Write a concise `description` in an imperative mood (e.g., "add feature" not "added feature").
4. If there are breaking changes, add a footer starting with `BREAKING CHANGE:`.
5. **Performance** : If the code has performance implications, add a footer starting with `PERFORMANCE:`.

## Examples
`feat(auth): implement login with google`

## How to provide feedback
1. Use the `code-review` skill to provide feedback on code style and best practices.
2. suggest alternative solutions if the code is not following best practices.
