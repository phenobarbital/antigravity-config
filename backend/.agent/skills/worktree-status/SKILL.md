name: worktree-status
description: Use to inspect the current git worktree setup, show the active/likely-active worktree, verify cleanliness, and remind the agent to work only inside the worktree (keywords: worktree status, which worktree, where am I, sanity check, active branch).
---

# Goal
Show the current worktree situation and prevent accidental edits in the primary working directory.

# Rules
- Do not make code changes.
- Do not commit, push, or open PRs.
- Only inspect and report.

# Steps
1) Confirm git repo
- If not in a git repo, report that and stop.

2) Show worktrees
- Run: `git worktree list`
- Identify:
  - the primary worktree (usually the repo root)
  - any additional worktrees (candidates)

3) Determine the active / likely-active worktree
- If `.worktrees/_active.json` exists:
  - Read and report `branch`, `base`, `path`.
  - Verify the path exists.
  - Mark this as **Active (recorded)**.
- Else (no `_active.json`):
  - From `git worktree list`, collect non-primary worktrees.
  - If there are no additional worktrees:
    - Report: "No additional worktrees found."
    - Skip to Step 5.
  - If there is exactly one additional worktree:
    - Treat it as **Likely active (only candidate)**.
  - If there are multiple additional worktrees:
    - Determine "most likely active" using this heuristic order (no filesystem changes):
      1) Prefer a worktree whose path starts with `.worktrees/` (repo-local convention).
      2) Among those, prefer one whose branch name matches common feature patterns:
         - `feat/*`, `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `bugfix/*`, `chore/*`
      3) If still multiple, pick the one that appears last in `git worktree list` output (often newest).
    - Mark it as **Likely active (heuristic)**.
  - For the chosen likely-active worktree, set:
    - `path` = candidate path
    - `branch` = candidate branch

4) Verify cleanliness (active or likely-active)
- If an active/likely-active worktree path is known:
  - Run: `git -C <path> status --porcelain`
  - If non-empty: report "worktree is NOT clean" and show a short summary of modified/untracked.
  - If empty: report "worktree is clean".
  - Also report the branch: `git -C <path> rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`.

5) Guardrail reminder
- If an active/likely-active worktree exists:
  - Explicitly state: "Do all feature edits inside: <path>."
- If no active/likely-active worktree exists:
  - Suggest using `worktree-start-feature` to create one for a new feature.

# Output format
- Worktrees: list (path + branch)
- Active worktree: branch/path and whether it is recorded or heuristic
- Cleanliness: clean / not clean (active/likely-active)
- Reminder: where to work
