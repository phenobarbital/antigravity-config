## Why

<!-- Explain the motivation for this change. What problem does this solve? Why now?
     Write this in plain language — no implementation details needed. -->

## What Changes

<!-- Describe what will change from the user's perspective.
     Be specific about new capabilities, modifications, or removals.
     Focus on WHAT, not HOW. -->

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
<!-- Capabilities being introduced.
     Use kebab-case identifiers (e.g., user-auth, data-export, api-rate-limiting).
     Each accepted capability will generate a spec file at docs/sdd/specs/<name>.spec.md -->
- `<name>`: <brief description of what this capability covers>

### Modified Capabilities
<!-- Existing capabilities whose REQUIREMENTS are changing (not just implementation).
     Only list here if spec-level behavior changes.
     Use existing spec names from docs/sdd/specs/. Leave empty if no requirement changes. -->
- `<existing-name>`: <what requirement is changing>

## Impact

<!-- Who and what is affected? Consider:
     - End users (behavior changes, new UI, breaking changes)
     - APIs (new endpoints, changed contracts)
     - Dependencies (new packages, version bumps)
     - Other systems (integrations, deployment) -->

## Open Questions

<!-- Anything unresolved that should be discussed before proceeding. -->
- Question 1
